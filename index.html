                            Hi, I’m Samuel Stites Allen. I recently graduated with a Bachelor’s degree in Engineering from the University of Vermont’s College of Engineering and Mathematical Sciences, with a focus split primarily between Civil and Mechanical Engineering. 
                            Over the past several years, I’ve worked on a variety of engineering projects, both independently and as part of a team. These projects include structural analyses and finite element analyses—check out some of them on my <a href="project.html">Projects</a> tab. 
                            I’m currently seeking opportunities to apply my skills and contribute to professional engineering projects.

                            I'm originally from Louisville, Kentucky, where I was born and raised.
                            Outside of class, I’m a passionate golfer — I play on UVM's club golf team and am always on the lookout for new courses to explore. 
                            But golf is just one part of my athletic life. 
                            I’ve been playing soccer since I was two and continued through high school. 
                            These days, I still make time for intramural soccer, along with a long list of other sports. 
                            I play intramural broomball, basketball, volleyball, pickleball, wiffleball, trenchball, and even some ice hockey.

                            I’m also a self-proclaimed nerd, and I don’t limit myself to just one realm of nerddom.
                            I’m a huge Star Wars fan — complete with a couple of lightsabers and an extensive LEGO Star Wars collection. 
                            I’m into a wide range of video games across different genres, and to a slightly lesser degree, I’ve picked up a fair amount of superhero knowledge as well.
                            I also tend to nerd out overboard games because of the analytical thinking and strategic skills required to excell. 
                            One of my favorite hobbies is graphic design. I grew up in a home that deeply valued art, and graphic design became my creative outlet into that world.
                            Check out my <a href="graphic.html">portfolio</a> to see the drawings I’m most proud of!
